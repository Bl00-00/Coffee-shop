                Our coffee beans are roasted twice per week and we receive them the next day to ensure their freshness for both the beverages we make in house and the retail beans we offer for sale.
				We have carefully selected Zingerman’s Coffee out of our neighboring city, 
				Ann Arbor, MI as our exclusive roaster for many factors including the close relationships they have with their coffee farmers as well as the ethical means by which they purchase their products. 
				Zingerman’s roasts small batches of coffee beans often and cups them continually to ensure they’re getting the best flavor possible. Our Cold Brew, also from Zingerman’s, is unlike any in the area.
				Only specific beans from South America and Indonesia are used for the preparation of Zingerman’s Cold Brew, they are coarsely ground and steep for 16 hours at 42 degrees. 
				This concentrate is then either bottled for a quick refreshing beverage on the go or used in our iced coffee’s and frozen beverages!
