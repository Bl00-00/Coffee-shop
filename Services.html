                       <h3>Art</h3>
                        <p>Art expresses emotions or is an expression of life. Art is a creation that allows for interpretation of any kind. 
					  I have read that art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. 
					  I believe that nature is an art as well. </p>

                        <h3>Music</h3>
                        <p>In some ways, music is a lot like literature. It can be pleasing, enlightening, even life-changing.
					   A great song, like a great book, affects the listener in unanticipated ways and resonates long after the music has ceased.</p>
